# LeetCode

This is the `LeetCode` code repo.

I use the VSCode plugin `Leetcode` to interact with Leetcode.

Now I mainly use `Python` and `Typescript`.

Take the chance to improve coding sense and algorithm thinking.

I usually take monthly exercise, so every day I'll add one new question to this repo.
